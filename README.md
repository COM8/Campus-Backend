# Campus-Backend

This repository holds the following components:
* `api` - the proto API definition in the `CampusService.proto`.
* `client` - example clients on how to connect to the backend.
* `server` - the actual server implementation serving both REST at [api.tum.de](https://api.tum.de)
   and gRPC endpoints at at [api-grpc.tum.de](https://api-grpc.tum.de).

The API is publicly available for use by anyone, but most notably its the main backend system for the
TUM Campus Apps (Android, iOS and Windows).

Please be respectful with its usage!
